    AUTHOR: Rich Johnson
    EMAIL: rjohnson@upwell.com
    Change Log:
        2017-12-15 - Initial creation
.SYNOPSIS
    This script installs RSAT for Windows 10 1709+.  
    This script is called via a scheduled task or an immediate task (via GPO) with the following details:
        General Tab
            - runas: SYSTEM (does not require 'run as highest privileges')
        Actions Tab
            - Program/script: powershell.exe
            - Arguments: -executionpolicy bypass -command \\server\share\installRSAT.ps1
.DESCRIPTION 
    What does this script do?
    - Checks to see if RSAT is installed, if so it exits
    - Copies the isntallation file to the local machine (installation is faster)
    - Installs RSAT via wusa.exe
    - Confirms correct installation
    What do I need to do?
    - Download RSAT (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520)
    - Place the .msu file on your network file share
    - Search this script for <changeme> and replace it with the required data
.PARAMETERS
    - This script takes no parameters
.Example
    >.\installRSAT
    Runs the script and installs RSAT, assuming the installation file exists on the remote share
#>

# Location where this script will log to
$logLocation = "$env:ProgramData\installRSAT.txt"

# Turn this to on if you want additional debug logging.  Off will overwrite On if you uncomment the <debug = "off"> line.
# Debug logging will show you the value of all variables so you can see if varable logic problems exist
$debug = "on"
#$debug = "off"
