    NAME: installLAPS.ps1
    AUTHOR: Rich Johnson
    EMAIL: rjohnson@upwell.com
    Change Log:
        2018-01-19 - Initial creation 
        
.SYNOPSIS
    Runs a task that installs the LAPS admin GUI on PAWs and registers the admpwd.dll file on all other clients.  We don't want the
    GUI on standard user workstations, so they only get the dll.
        General Tab
            - runas: SYSTEM (does not require 'run as highest privileges'
        Actions Tab
            - Program/script: powershell.exe
            - Arguments: -executionpolicy bypass -command \\server\share\installLAPS.ps1 <org>
.DESCRIPTION 
    What does this script do?
    - Checks to see if the LAPS dll is registered.  If not, it registers it.
    - If the computer is a PAW, it installs the LAPS GUI tool to C:\Program Files\LAPS
    What do I need to do?
    - Read the LAPS Administration guide which will walk you through extending your AD schema and setting permissions in AD for users to read your LAPS passwords
    - Download the LAPS files, extract them, and place them on a network share
    - Search this script for <changeme> and replace it with the required data.
.PARAMETER location
    No parameters required
.Example
    >.\installLAPS
    This will install the client on a Draper workstation
