#Backup script using robocopy to get multiple drives backed up, by Dysthymia.
#Assuming we want to format the destination drive before backing up
#Version 0.9 to 1.0 - Removed multithreading argument as it was lower than the default (which is 8), added backup mode switch, and logging to root of backup drive.
#Version 1.0 to 1.1 - Added emptying of the recycle bin and more idiot proof warning before formatting.
#Version 1.1 to 1.2 - Added what I call "minutia" since I'd been adding it manually anyway.
#Version 1.2 to 1.3 - Added Windows Backup server option. Unable to determine how much space is needed, so going by my own test result.
#Version 1.3 to 1.4 - Added detection of running VMs in VMware Workstation Player, and a choice to either shut them down or abandon system backup (it crashes otherwise because I run my VM on my C: drive).
#Version 1.4 to 1.5 - Adding proper system backup allocation detection (by detecting system drive size minus free space), and a variable to pad the system backup allocation size.
#Version 1.5 to 1.6 - Automatically detect maximum drive numbers, leaving minimum at 0 to allow for other backup options. Also reminding users of the current drive information before asking them for any drive letters.
#Version 1.6 to 1.7 - Accounted for the size of the pre-defined but customizable minutia folders, alerting the user to how much space they'll need.
